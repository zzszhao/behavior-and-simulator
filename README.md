SageMath 9.3+
Some older versions of SageMath contain a faulty FPLLL version which contains a bug that prevents our experiments from running successfully. Either use SageMath 9.3+ or manually install fpylll.


The data-bkz1 contains the raw data generated by bkz1.
Some of the code was borrowed from https://github.com/repo-fplll/Statistical-Behavior-of-BKZ#statistical-behavior-of-bkz.
